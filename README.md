# Cryptocurrencies Analysis
## Objective
It was learned the use of  machine learning using unsupervised algorithms, exploring data when we're not sure what we're looking for. therefore we are in the posicion to analyze data without a clear output in mind.
It was used The K-means algorithm, the main unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data into clusters. We built on this by speeding up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features.

Before starting this module, you should have a strong understanding of training and testing datasets.

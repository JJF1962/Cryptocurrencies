# Cryptocurrencies Analysis

## Objective
It was learned the use of  machine learning applying unsupervised algorithms, exploring data when we're not sure what we're looking for. therefore we are in the posicion to analyze data without a clear output in mind. This module is very challenging a we were expose to a different way of thinking.
It was used The K-means algorithm, the main unsupervised algorithm that groups similar data into clusters. We built on this by speeding up the process using principal component analysis (PCA), which employs many different features, in summary we learned to: 
* Describe the differences between supervised and unsupervised learning, including real-world examples of each.
* Preprocess data for unsupervised learning.
* Cluster data using the K-means algorithm.
* Determine the best number of centroids for K-means using the elbow curve.
* Use PCA to limit features and speed up the model.
